Things to do and to note if this is going it to production

1. ------------------------------------------------------------
this should support mutlipule langues so problly the most common ones that the GNC compiler takes in i.e C,Cpp,Fortran and add bindings for python, maybe julia and other later

this means we need to follow the same abi rules for each languge probly external c i think
look into this more later

2. -----------------------------------------------
Need to have multi build types and other platforms for example must support serial, parllel cpu, invida  and amd gpus

3. what c++  year should be done newwerviosn of  c++ will  not be support be older  compiler (I THINK) check into this

4. data distbution
also note this should be a 2d domain decompolation with 
I am thinking obvously leave the first dim alone this is the var.
but the next 4 arrays I am thinking we find which one varies the least smoothest slopes smallest dirviates those change distbute unless others are large think about this more alterr
idk


5. make a test build and a realse build


clean up the repo

TESTING python env and compressor  
git clone https://github.com/E53klasky/Cpython_pytorch_converter.git


fix python code above to have the right path for the pretrained model



test verified commit
